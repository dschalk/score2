**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
This is the first part of what will eventually be a Haskell version of the real time, multi-player game of Score!, which is online in its NodeJS form at http://score.nodejitsu.com. Players use basic arithmetic and concatenation to make the number "20" out of four random numbers simulating the roll of two six-sided, one twelve-sided, and one twenty-sided dice. It is a good way to have fun while increasing skill in arithmetic, including subtracting negative numbers and dividing by fractions. It can be played solitaire, or in online competition with others.
