**Rules of "Score"**

Four dice are rolled. The default die are two six-sided, one twelve-sided, and one twenty-sided die. The goal is to make the number "20" in two or three steps using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and/or concatenation.

###### If a player calls out "Score!", or clicks "SCORE" in the computer version, he or she must quickly demonstrate how to make the number "20". Failure to do so loses the player one point; success gains a point. Clicking "SCORE" starts a countdown which currently allow 30 secondes, which is more than enough time. If a player clicks "IMPOSSIBLE", a 60-second countdown begins. If no player clicks "SCORE" during the 60 seconds, the player who clicked "IMPOSSIBLE" gains one point. If a player clicks "SCORE" during the countdown and succeeds in making "20" within 30 seconds, the player who clicked "IMPOSSIBLE" loses two points. It is possible for the player who clicked "IMPOSSIBLE" to also click "SCORE". Making the number "20" within 30 seconds gains back one of the two points lost because the 60 second countdown was successfully interrupted.

In order to gain a point by making the number "20", a player must use a number generated by a previous computation. Those number have the color red.

This flow of this application can best be understood by following the message prefixes.

First, CC#$42 is sent from the login form.
The server intercepts CC#$42 and if everything is in order, responds with:
```haskell
liftIO $ modifyMVar_ state $ \s -> do
  let s' = addClient client s  
  WS.sendTextData conn $ "CC#$42" `mappend` T.intercalate (", ") (map tr s')
  print $ "CC#$42" `mappend` T.intercalate (", ") (map tr s')
  broadcast (getName client `mappend` " joined") s'
  broadcast ("CB#$42" `mappend` (T.concat(intersperse (T.pack "<br>") (map tr s')))) s'
   return s' 
```

"WS.sendTextData conn ..." is critically important for initializing the newly logged in browser, hiding the login form and initializing the message form and display. All browsers receive notification of the login along with the updated server state in the message prefixed by "CB#$42". In the message board section of the server file, "CB#$42" prefixed messages are intercpted and used for updating all browsers with the current server state.
```haskell
    else if ("CB#$42" `T.isPrefixOf` msg)
    	then
            do
                st <- readMVar state
                broadcast ("CB#$42" `mappend` (T.concat (intersperse (T.pack "<br>") (map tr st)))) st
```
The server state goes out as a text message and is received as a Javascript String containing HTML.

Back to the login section: "addClient" updates the server state MVar and returns the server state, whose type is defined as follows:
```haskell
type Client = (Name, Score, WS.Connection)
type ServerState = [Client]
newServerState :: ServerState
newServerState = []
```
The server state is created at the start of the main function as so:
```haskell
main = do 
    state <- newMVar newServerState
    ...
```
Now let's get back to following the trail of prefixes. As mentioned above, when the server receives "CB#$42", it broadcases the server state (parsed into Text) with the same prefix it received: "CB#$42". The browsers intercept the message, preventing it from becoming a chat message, and use the fresh server state text (now a Javascript String) to update the player-score displays in all connected browsers. Here is the code for intercepting messages:
```haskell
function onMessage(event) {
    var d2 = event.data.substring(0,6);
    var p = $(document.createElement('p')).text(event.data);

    switch (d2) {
        case "CB#$42":
            $("#users").html(event.data.substring(6));
        break;

        case "CA#$42":
            d = -1;
            console.log("Received GO message.")
            var l = event.data.substring(7);
            ls = l.split(",");
            var a = ls[0]
            var b = ls[1]
            var c = ls[2]
            var d = ls[3]
            roll.a = a;
            roll.b = b;
            roll.c = c;
            roll.d = d;
            $("#drag3").html(a);
            $("#drag5").html(b);
            $("#drag7").html(c);
            $("#drag9").html(d);
            $("#info").html(a + " &nbsp; " + b + " &nbsp; " + c + " &nbsp; " + d + "<br><br>");
        break;

        case "CC#$42":
            ws.send("CB#$42");
        break;

        case "CD#$42":
            $('#warnings').append('CD#$42 was intercepted in the messages section.');
        break;

        default:

        $('#messages').append(p);
        $('#messages').animate({scrollTop: $('#messages')[0].scrollHeight});
        break;
    }
}
```
Prefixing messages with six-digit codes allows them to be conveniently organized in a single switch routine testing the value of "d2". In the browsers, "CB#42" updates the scoreboards with the server state. "CA#42" promts the server to compute of a new set random numbers for the next round of play.
